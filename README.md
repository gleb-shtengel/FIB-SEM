# This is a repository for FIB-SEM data processing and analysis
The main features of this workflow:
-   Performs analysis of image noise statistics that allows determining optimal ratio of InLens and ESB signals for fused image with increased SNR.
-   Performs image flattening to correct for non-uniform detector sensitivity.
-   Allows various transformation models for stack registration (Rigid Translation, Translation and Scale, Similarity Transformation, Affine Transformation, as well as Regularized Affine Transformation).
-   Allows for evaluation of the registration quality using various metrics (Normalized Sum of Absolute Differences, Normalized Cross-Correlation, Normalized Mutual Information, Fourier Shell Correlation).
-   The resulting registered stack can be saved as a single MRC or HDF5 file (the registered stack is a DASK array, so extending it to Zarr or N5 should also be straightforward).
-   Can be performed on a single workstation (with decent number of cores and memory). A month-long FIB-SEM acquisition takes about 2-3 days to process.

I have recently (2024) come across a problem. RANSAC implementation in skimage.measure (from skimage.measure.ransac) started working unreliably and frequently converges to incorrect solution with very small number of inliers.
I am not 100% sure on the exact source of this behavior. I think the problem is caused by a modification in function _dynamic_max_trials_ in scikit-image package (specifically, skimage.measure.fit.py) from version 0.19.2 to 0.20.00. So, for now I have created my own copies of the skimage.measure._dynamic_max_trials_ and skimage.measure.ransac

This package uses OpenCV implementation of SIFT. SIFT is part of standard OpenCV releases for version 3.4.1 or earlier. If you have newer version of OpenCV-python installed, SIFT will most likely be not part of it (because of patent issues), and the Python command sift = cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT_create() will generate error. In this case replace it with a version supporting SIFT using these commands (in anaconda command window):

Uninstall the OpenCV:
```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python
```

Then install the contrib version of OpenCV:
```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

Then use pip to install the repository directly
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ FIBSEM_gs_py
```
